## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/With-555/Fake-API-Maker.git
   cd Fake-API-Maker
   ```

2. Build the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

### Creating Endpoints

You can create custom endpoints by modifying the JSON configuration files in the `config` directory. Each file can define different types of data structures, such as:

- User profiles
- Product listings
- Blog posts

### Example

To create a simple user endpoint, you might define a JSON file like this:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once your JSON is set up, you can access the endpoint via:

```
GET http://localhost:8000/api/users/
```

### Generating Fake Data

You can also generate fake data using the Faker library. To do this, simply call the relevant functions in your Python code:

```python
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()
print(fake.name())
print(fake.email())
```
